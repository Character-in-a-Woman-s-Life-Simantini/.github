When Namita got down at Govindpur bus stand at 10 am, Madha was waiting for an autorickshaw. Since both of them had phone numbers, there was no problem in identifying each other. Leaving Namita at Sir's quarters, Madha went to get some family documents.

Namita could tell from her father's clothes that this room was where her father lived. And the other room must have belonged to Sir. After keeping her clothes and dresses, she started arranging the room first. It is the nature of women to enter a house and first start arranging the untidy house. If a woman or a girl is not at home, that house is compared to hell. A woman's hand must be in making the house beautiful. Be it a relationship or an environment, a woman is responsible for maintaining and decorating everything.

Before Namita set foot in the house, Madha had already told her, "Mom, freshen up, I am coming with the family." Madha left. While leaving, she pointed out some places to Nami. Namita walked around the house and inspected the house. She saw the bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, dining room and guessed which room her father lived in. She saw some of her father's belongings and guessed that this was where her father slept. She would take his bag and keep it in the house.

Some wet clothes were not drying. Fish were hanging on the wire in the fish tank. An unpleasant smell was emanating from the house. They looked as if they had died. Flies were buzzing on the dining room. The teapot had never been cleaned. The house has been covered in black for months. It is a long way from being cleaned, as the house has not been swept for months. The bedsheets are torn and the bed is lying in a corner.

Seeing these scenes made Namita dizzy.my website name
